Data Structures in C
====================

This project contains implementations for many different types of data
structures commonly taught in computer science, and many of which are
commonly used in real-world production environments. These basic data
structures represent small building blocks upon which large data-processing
applications can be built and run efficiently.

This project was created as a reference for myself, as I learned about
these data structures and algorithms. Lately it seems to be getting
visibility from others. As such, visitors should understand a few things.

1. The code for these data structures contains very little error checking.
This is intentional, as to reduce the amount of code clutter and focus
solely on the core components of the algorithms. In a production environment,
error checking is likely needed for most of these examples.

2. The code examples generally lacks consistent naming conventions. Everything
from the names of files, to names of functions, to names of variables, can
differ from one example to the next. This is a result of using multiple
resources when researching these data structures. I plan to go through
and try to standardize everything.

3. Some algorithms have a README file with a brief description, but most
don't. I plan to try to add more documentation to help visitors decide
which data structure and algorithm is most appropriate for their application.
