A trie is a data structure optimized for retrieval (re"trie"val).

Like a DST, it organizes the keys into a tree based on their bit values.
But unlike a DST, it keeps the key values in order which allows us to
implement a sort and select function.

Trie trees are well balanced with near optimal search cost.

Keeping keys in order comes at a slight cost of increased memory
requirements for more tree nodes.
