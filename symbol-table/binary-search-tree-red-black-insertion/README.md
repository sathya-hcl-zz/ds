A red-black tree is a binary tree where each node contains an extra bit
used to create an abstract representation of a 2-3-4 tree (a tree with
nodes that have 2, 3, or 4 children). This algorithm allows us to do
insertions and with only a few rotations, maintain a better balanced tree
than other BST insertion methods.

Overhead for insertion is minimal and the trees it produces aree nearly
optimal.
