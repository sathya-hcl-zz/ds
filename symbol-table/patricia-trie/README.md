Patricia = "practical algorithm to retrieve information codes in alphanumeric"

A patricia trie is an improvement on a conventional trie such that it
removed the need for excess nodes.

A patricia trie is most effective with variable length keys that are
potentially very large.

When large keys are not a factor, performmance is comparable with standard
DTS and binary trees.

Note that this implementation does not have a delete function.
