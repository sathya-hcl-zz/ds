A skip list is an ordered linked list where each node contains multiple
links to a node further down the list. This arrangement gives us a speedy
search operation. Skip lists allow for the full range of operations to be
supported, and are an attractive for that reason. However, the overall
performance is generlaly slower than BST implementations.
